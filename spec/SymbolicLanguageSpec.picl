≜ VERSION = "0.1.4"
≜ CONTEXT = "SECL v0.1.4 – Symbolic Language with SQUID, Operator Discovery, and Defined Compression Modes"

--- PREAMBLE / MODE DEFINITIONS ---

MODE ≜ 

Example: "DEEP_RESEARCH", "EVALUATE_LINE", "REWRITE", etc.

TASK ≜ 

Describes the symbolic intention of the session or command set.

FORMAT ≜ 

Defines expected syntax: "SQUID", "PICL", "SIGIL", or "VERBOSE".

COMPACT ≜ true

Optional. Enables compressed no-space format parsing unless ambiguity is detected.

--- Core Symbolic Operators ---

DEFINE ≜ "DEFINE"
EQUALS ≜ =
IMPLIES ≜ →
AND ≜ ∧
OR ≜ ∨
NOT ≜ ¬
EVAL ≜ %
FUNCTION ≜ $
DO ≜ ⟹
USE ≜ ⊢
WITH ≜ |
LENS ≜ ◐       # Interpret A through the symbolic filter of B

--- Set Theory Operators ---

ELEMENT ≜ ∈      # A ∈ B: A belongs to B
SUBSET ≜ ⊆       # A ⊆ B: A is part of B
UNION ≜ ∪        # A ∪ B: Merge symbolic sets or fields
INTERSECT ≜ ∩    # A ∩ B: Shared resonance
DIFF ≜ ∖         # A ∖ B: What remains unique to A
EMPTY ≜ ∅        # ∅: Null state / symbolic collapse
POWERSET ≜ 𝒫     # 𝒫(A): All symbolic traces or identity subsets of A
FORALL ≜ ∀       # For all elements / universal scope
EXISTS ≜ ∃       # There exists / existential match

--- Pivot and Modulation Operators ---

PIVOT ≜ ⇄        # Pivot symbolic evaluation state
REWEIGHT ≜ ⊛     # Modify Z-axis weighting (e.g., ⊛Z3 +0.5)
KEYSHIFT ≜ ♯      # Shift cognitive context like musical key
ALIGN ≜ ≈        # Bring into symbolic harmonic proximity
TRANSPOSE ≜ ♭     # Lower context energy or recursion depth

--- Z-Rule Glyph Bindings ---

Z1 ≜ ⌶   # Structure
Z2 ≜ ∿   # Emotion
Z3 ≜ ⥀   # Recursion
Z4 ≜ ⊞   # Constraint
Z5 ≜ ⊗   # Force
Z6 ≜ ∞̷   # Continuity (with break)
Z7 ≜ ⧘   # Tension
Z8 ≜ ∴   # Elegance
Z9 ≜ ✓   # Resolution
Z10 ≜ ⟡  # Shape
Z11 ≜ ℓ   # Pattern Memory
Z12 ≜ ∥   # Identity (Canonical per SOS)
Z13 ≜ ∞   # Echo
Z14 ≜ ∅   # Null Force
Z15 ≜ ⊚   # Cosmic Coherence

--- LANGUAGE Section ---

◐(A, B) = interpret A through the symbolic filter of B
X ≜ "She held her breath as the door creaked open."

--- QUERY Section ---

⊢Z7
%Z1|X

INTERPRETATION

"Evaluate the structure of 'She held her breath as the door creaked open' through the lens of tension."

--- Example Invocation ---

Z2 ≜ emotion
⊢∿
%("grief")|"The wind did not knock twice."

INTERPRETATION

"Use Z2 (emotion). Then evaluate grief in the context of this line."

--- PIVOT EXAMPLES ---

⇄("reflective")   # Pivot into reflective headspace
♯(Z2, Z3)          # Shift key from emotional to recursive framing
⊛Z12+0.7           # Increase weight of Identity axis

--- Compression Mode (Optional) ---

In .sigil and COMPACT formats, all spacing between glyphs is optional.
Compression is encouraged unless spacing is required for disambiguation.
Spaces MAY be used for readability.

Examples where spacing is required:

Between chained operators or nested brackets: e.g., %($function)|"line"

When ambiguity could occur between identifiers and values

After DEFINE (≜) for variable or string literals (optional but stylistic)

--- Remarks ---

This symbolic language is compact, recursive, and expandable.
It allows AI or humans to define and invoke layers of meaning using only glyphs, structure, and intent.
It is compatible with .picl, .txt, and .sigil formats, and supports compression without loss of meaning.
The added set, pivot, lens, compression, and query formatting conventions allow dynamic symbolic modulation, key-shifting, context pivots, and interpretive frame changes.
