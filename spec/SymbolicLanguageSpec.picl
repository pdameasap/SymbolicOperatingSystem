# --- LANGUAGE Section ---
≜ LENS(A, B) = interpret A through the symbolic filter of B
≜ X = "She held her breath as the door creaked open."

# --- QUERY Section ---
⊢ Z7
%Z1 | X

# INTERPRETATION
# "Evaluate the structure of 'She held her breath as the door creaked open' through the lens of tension."

# --- Example Invocation ---
≜ Z2 = emotion
⊢ Z2
%("grief") | "The wind did not knock twice."

# INTERPRETATION
# "Use Z2 (emotion). Then evaluate grief in the context of this line."

# --- Remarks ---
# This symbolic language is compact, recursive, and expandable.
# It allows AI or humans to define and invoke layers of meaning using only glyphs, structure, and intent.
# It is compatible with .picl, .txt, and .sigil formats, and supports compression without loss of meaning.
