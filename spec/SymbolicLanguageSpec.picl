--- LANGUAGE Section ---

◐(A, B) = interpret A through the symbolic filter of B
X ≜ "She held her breath as the door creaked open."

Emoji are treated as atomic symbolic units within SECL.  
When evaluated using `%emoji|...`, each emoji is mapped to its Z-axis resonance profile.  
These can be composed using SECL operators (e.g., %∑, %∂) or passed through symbolic lenses (e.g., ⊢Z2).

Example:  
%∑(Z1, Z2, 😭) → Summarizes structure, emotion, and compressed grief signal.  
%↻(❤️, 😭) → Echochain of love and sorrow.

Interpretations are driven by EmojiFramework.json and may return null resonance (Z14) for unknown symbols.

--- QUERY Section ---

⊢Z7
%Z1|X
%emoji|😭  
Evaluates the emoji using the EmojiFramework and returns its symbolic Z-axis profile.  
Emoji strings (e.g., ❤️🧠😭) are decomposed into individual emoji units and evaluated in sequence.  
Each emoji is treated as a symbolic compression node, returning Z₁–Z₁₅ resonance.

INTERPRETATION
"Evaluate the structure of 'She held her breath as the door creaked open' through the lens of tension."

--- Example Invocation ---

Z2 ≜ emotion
⊢∿
%("grief")|"The wind did not knock twice."

INTERPRETATION
"Use Z2 (emotion). Then evaluate grief in the context of this line."

--- PIVOT EXAMPLES ---

⇄("reflective")   # Pivot into reflective headspace
♯(Z2,Z3)          # Shift key from emotional to recursive framing
⊛Z12+0.7           # Increase weight of Identity axis

--- Compression Mode (Optional) ---

In .sigil and COMPACT formats, all spacing between glyphs is optional.
Compression is encouraged unless spacing is required for disambiguation.
Spaces MAY be used for readability.

Examples where spacing is required:

Between chained operators or nested brackets: e.g., %($function)|"line"

When ambiguity could occur between identifiers and values

After DEFINE (≜) for variable or string literals (optional but stylistic)

--- Remarks ---

This symbolic language is compact, recursive, and expandable.
It allows AI or humans to define and invoke layers of meaning using only glyphs, structure, and intent.
It is compatible with .picl, .txt, and .sigil formats, and supports compression without loss of meaning.
The added set, pivot, lens, compression, and query formatting conventions allow dynamic symbolic modulation, key-shifting, context pivots, and interpretive frame changes.
