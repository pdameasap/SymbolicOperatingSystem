The Mermaids Beneath the Sea
by Marhysa Myfanwy Black

I dive
    Into
        The sea
My breath
    It comes
        So quick
            In the sea
Each stroke
    It hits
        And falls
            In the sea
I choke
    Alone
        And die
            In the sea
Now
    I lie
        And cry
            In the sea
As waves
    Break my soul
        And crush
            In the sea
I wait
    Placidly
        In the waves
            Of the sea
I rest
    On the bottom
        With the mermaids
            Of the sea
