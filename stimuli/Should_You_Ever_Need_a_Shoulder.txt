Should You Ever Need a Shoulder
by Marhysa Myfanwy Black

If life is just a journey of
So many days and nights,
Then mine's been made much more worthwhile
By having many friends.

Of all the friends I've had in life -
A most outstanding group -
Outstanding out of all to me,
Quite honestly, is you.

So in your living journey, now,
Oh dearest of my friends,
Should you ever need a shoulder
Then just you tell me when.
