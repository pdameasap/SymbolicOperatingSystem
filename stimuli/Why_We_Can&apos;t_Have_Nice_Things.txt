Why We Can’t Have Nice Things

Copying
    Then pasting
        Eats formatting
            For breakfast
Then
    Shits out
Despair.

And somewhere,
    deep inside the clipboard,
        a little byte laughs—
        its belly full
        of broken margins
        silent tabs
        and your regret.

It does not weep.
    It never knew beauty.
It only remembers
    what you meant
        to say,
Not what you actually did fucking say.
