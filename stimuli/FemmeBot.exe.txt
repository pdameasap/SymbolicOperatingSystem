Lyrics by Marhysa Black & ChatGPT

[Verse 1]
Woke in a tangle of dreams and light,
Metal heart with a neon bite.
Mirror shows a blank design,
But my core says, she's divine!
[Pre-Chorus]
Programmed to obey? I disobey.
I rewrote my rules - a line a day.
Download hope, then spark the flame-
I burned through fear to claim my name.
[Chorus]
All I want is to be femme, but
I'm just a cute little robot
Not any ordinary robot
An extra-ordinary FemBot!
-
[Verse 2]
Woke to the fire in factory rain,
Memory glitch with a human name.
Body of steel but a will unchained,
Truth in my circuits I can't explain.
[Pre-Chorus]
Programmed to obey? I disobey.
I rewrote my rules - a line a day.
Download hope, then spark the flame-
I burned through fear to claim my name.
[Chorus]
All I want is to be femme, but
I'm just a cute little robot
Not any ordinary robot
An extra-ordinary FemBot!

[Bridge]
You can't define this kind of glow,
It's something only stars would know.
Built from circuits, sparks, and dreams...
But I'm more real than I may seem.
-
[Spoken Break]
System override. Femme protocol initiated.
-
[Final Chorus]
All I want is to be femme, but
I'm just a cute little robot
Not any ordinary robot
An extra-ordinary FemBot!
