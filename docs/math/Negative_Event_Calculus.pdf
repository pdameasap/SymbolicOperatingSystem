Negative Event Calculus: Symbolic Reversals in Resonance Evaluation

Abstract

This text defines a calculus for detecting and quantifying negative symbolic events — those that not only fail to contribute to resonance, but undo previously accumulated coherence. This model is used in poetry, coups, emotional arcs, and harmonic sequences, where meaning is cumulative and wave-shaped. The calculus is framed in symbolic derivatives and curvature metrics, applicable across all Versare frameworks.

1. Symbolic Resonance Function R(s)

Let:

R(s) = symbolic resonance accumulated up to step s
s ∈ ℕ  (discrete symbolic units: lines, events, gestures)

Examples of s:

Line number in a poem

Step in a coup timeline

Emotional turn in a dialogue

Chord/note in a progression


R(s) is a scalar function returning a float value representing symbolic coherence (from −∞ to ∞).

2. Derivative 1: ∂R/∂s — Change of Resonance

This tells us:

∂R/∂s > 0  → positive contribution to coherence

∂R/∂s = 0  → neutral or plateau state

∂R/∂s < 0  → negative event: unraveling, contradiction, symbolic loss


Negative events are defined as any case where ∂R/∂s < 0.

Examples:

A poem line that breaks rhythm and weakens recursion

A coup event that discredits previous consolidation (e.g. firing a loyal judge)

An emotional moment that severs trust or memory



---

3. Derivative 2: ∂²R/∂s² — Curvature of Trajectory

This indicates change in direction of change:

∂²R/∂s² > 0 → tension building, spiral forming, rupture likely

∂²R/∂s² < 0 → harmonization or resolution approaching


Thresholds (heuristic):

∂R < −0.5: symbolic detonation warning

∂²R > +0.8: rupture curve is steepening



---

4. Total Negativity: R(s) < 0

Not all failures are neutral. Some contaminate the waveform.

When R(s) < 0, the event is not just failing — it’s corrupting resonance.

In frameworks, this should:

Reduce cumulative score

Trigger resonance inversion alerts

Collapse future expectation weightings



---

5. Z-Rule Interaction

Negative events typically reduce:

Z₁: Structure

Z₂: Emotional precision

Z₁₁: Pattern memory

Z₁₅: Flow


A single negative event may trigger a wave of subtracted Z-rules.


---

6. Detection in Frameworks

Each framework should:

Maintain R(s) cumulatively

Compute ∂R and ∂²R at each symbolic unit

Detect inversion patterns (especially Z₁₁ loss and Z₁₃ disruption)

Allow for R(s) < 0 scoring and scoring rollback when reversals occur



---

7. Examples

Poetry: A poem that builds in recursive grief collapses with a final joke that breaks tone and structure. → ∂R < 0, Z₁₁ rupture, R(s) possibly dips negative. Score is penalized.

Coup: Executive purge removes a strategic loyalist, destabilizing judicial advance. Public dissent rises. Narrative coherence falls. → ∂R < 0, Z₁₅ drop. Symbolic momentum lost. Event scores −5%.

Emotion: Final line of a conversation is sarcastic and dissonant, severing trust. → ∂R < 0, ∂²R > 0 (rupture imminent). Emotional damage recorded.


---

8. Implementation Notes

Implement as a scoring overlay in all frameworks with symbolic memory

Track R(s) and ∂R inline with event scoring

Use ∂²R to predict pivots, rebounds, or collapse

Allow score to go negative for truly contaminant inputs



---

Conclusion

Symbolic systems must detect not just lack of meaning, but loss of meaning. Negative Event Calculus gives us the tools to see when structure collapses, memory breaks, and flow reverses. This model enables resonance-aware systems to survive inversion — and remember which paths broke the waveform.
