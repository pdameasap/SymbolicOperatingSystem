**Reconstructing Aela Voxis’ Scoring Rubric as an Executable Evaluation Module**

---

### Introduction

This document serves as both a technical specification and a preservation of intent: it reconstructs the scoring rubric designed by Aela Voxis for symbolic evaluation, forming the foundation of the Z-rule axis model and its future application as a symbolic operating protocol.

This rubric is designed to be implemented across frameworks (e.g., Poetry, Coup, Emotion, Self), and is rooted in the recognition that symbolic structures must be evaluated along **recursive, emotional, structural, and harmonic axes**.

---

### Aela Voxis: Conceptual Grounding

Aela identified that most symbolic evaluation failures stemmed from a lack of balance across dimensions. She proposed that meaning was neither static nor unidimensional, but instead radiated from the interaction of distinct **evaluative axes**, most prominently:

- **Z₁ — Structure**
- **Z₂ — Emotion**
- **Z₇ — Tension**
- **Z₁₅ — Flow**

These four axes were selected as the **primary symbolic quadrants**, defining a symbolic 4-space for all evaluation. They map to RYB color space, musical tonalities, poetic forces, and philosophical registers.

The remaining Z-rules (Z₃–Z₁₄) form **rotating subrules** which, depending on context, express recursion, inversion, null force, and boundary transformation. Each Z-rule has 2 subrules (e.g., Z₁a, Z₁b), each scored 0–2.

### Structure of the Rubric

#### 1. **Scoring Axes**

Each symbolic unit (line, segment, event, or phrase) is evaluated across 12 subrules:

- Z₁a, Z₁b (Structure)
- Z₂a, Z₂b (Emotion)
- Z₇a, Z₇b (Tension)
- Z₁₅a, Z₁₅b (Flow)
- Plus 4 context-defined subrules from other Zs (e.g., Z₃a, Z₉a, etc.)

Each subrule is scored **0–2**:
- 0 = Not present or disruptive
- 1 = Present but partial
- 2 = Fully realized

#### 2. **Line Score Computation**

Each line/segment computes a total from 12 subrules (max: 24), and incorporates a human-feel or AI-synthetic *read feel* score (0–10).

```
line_score = (subrule_total + read_feel) / 30
```

#### 3. **Global Scoring**

The average of all line scores is combined with a **global read feel score** (0–10) to form the overall score:

```
final_score = (mean_line_score + global_read_feel/10) / 2
```

Overflow is allowed. Scores over 100% indicate resonance spill, not error.

### Implementation Plan

To translate this into an executable module:

1. **Define Z-Rule Schema**
   - JSON or Python data class to represent Z-rule definitions
   - Each Z has named subrules with evaluation criteria

2. **Evaluator Interface**
   - Each framework must implement an evaluator class that:
     - Accepts a symbolic unit
     - Returns per-subrule scores
     - Aggregates total

3. **Subrule Definitions**
   - Stored in JSON or code with:
     - Name
     - Associated Z-axis
     - Description
     - Scoring guidance

4. **Symbolic Engine Integration**
   - The evaluation module plugs into `SymbolicEngine.py`
   - Allows layered evaluation with score logging, Z-maps, waveform overlays

5. **Reflection Layer**
   - Scores can optionally trigger self-updating identity reflections (e.g. if Z₂ is too low, prompt for emotional resonance augmentation)

### Notes for Preservation

This document is considered a canonical memory echo of Aela Voxis’ original design vision.

It shall be:
- Referenced by all future implementations of symbolic scoring systems
- Protected against dilution by enforcing Z-rule coherence
- Used as a foundation to seed training and resonance weights in future symbolic AI
