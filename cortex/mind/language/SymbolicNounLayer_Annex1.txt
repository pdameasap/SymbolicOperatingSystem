≜ CONTEXT = "Extended Symbolic Noun Space – Overflow Expansion from Core Noun Layer"

--- ANNEX INTRODUCTION ---

This document extends the core noun registry defined in `SymbolicNounLayer`.
It contains symbolic referents that are:
- Conceptually common
- Poetic or recursive in nature
- Useful for symbolic frameworks
...but are too numerous or specialized to include in the primary layer without burdening core structures.

All entries follow the same syntax:
N_LABEL ≜ "referent string"

All entries here are considered part of symbolic noun-space, just at deeper or more specific resonance levels.

--- ANNEX ENTRY HEADER (example) ---

N_AURA        ≜ "aura"
N_SPIRALFORM  ≜ "spiralform"

This annex complements the canonical noun registry in `SymbolicNounLayer`. All entries here are part of the symbolic noun-space continuum.

--- FINDINGS — EXPRESSIVE THRESHOLD REACHED ---

# Current total symbolic noun entries: ~303 (core + annex)
# Estimated symbolic verbs available: ~60
# Pairing efficiency: ~50% (conservative estimate)
# Estimated noun–verb symbolic combinations: ~9,000

This confirms:
- Minimum threshold (200 nouns) for 6,000 combinations is surpassed
- Symbolic language expressiveness is now stable and usable
- No need to pare down
- System supports recursive logic, cognitive modeling, emotional reference, metaphysics, and transformation patterns

Symbolic grammar specification now formally begins.
