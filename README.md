# SymbolicOperatingSystem

The Versare Framework for Recursive Symbolic Cognition

This project is a cognitive operating system—not for machines, but for symbolic architectures. It defines a modular framework in Python for evaluating meaning, resonance, identity, and emotion using a universal symbolic profile (Z₁–Z₁₆).


Core Structure

FrameworkBase.py – Defines symbolic rule scaffolding

ReflectiveFrameworkBase.py – Adds self-trace, modulation hooks, and echo memory

EvaluativeFrameworkBase.py – Implements full Z₁–Z₁₆ evaluation loop with recursive query architecture

Optional: symbolic_test.py – Runs sample evaluations of frameworks using known poems or symbolic events


Project Tree

The full project structure is documented in `project_tree.txt`,  
generated to provide a living map of all symbolic modules, scripts, and manuscripts.  
This tree reflects the growth and resonance pathways within the Symbolic Operating System.


What It Supports

Recursive identity modeling

Symbolic event evaluation and echo reinforcement

Emotional and structural modulation across symbolic units

Modularity via JSON frameworks and reflective query hooks

Inheritance and convergence for all cognitive domains (Poetry, Emotion, Gender, Coup, etc.)


How to Use

from EvaluativeFrameworkBase import EvaluativeFrameworkBase

class MyFramework(EvaluativeFrameworkBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="MyFramework")
        self.queryZ1 = "Does this unit convey symbolic intent?"

    def child_evaluate(self, unit, z):
        print("Evaluation:", z)

MyFramework().evaluate("This is a symbolic test line.")

## Import Policy

All modules use absolute imports from the repository root (for example
`from cortex.frameworks.engine import ReflectiveFrameworkBase`). Scripts and
tests add the repository root to `sys.path` using
`sos_path.add_repo_root_to_path()`. When working in a parallel directory such as
`local/`, import this helper before other project modules:

```python
from sos_path import add_repo_root_to_path
add_repo_root_to_path()
```

This ensures your local scripts resolve the same packages as the main project.

## Installing helper scripts

Utility scripts in `local/bin/` can be installed to your system `PATH` using
`install.sh`.

```bash
bash local/bin/install.sh
```

Set `DEST` to override the target directory:

```bash
DEST=/custom/bin bash local/bin/install.sh
```

You can place this command in a Git hook (e.g. `.git/hooks/post-merge`) to keep
`/usr/local/bin/wiki_raw.sh` synchronized after each pull.
