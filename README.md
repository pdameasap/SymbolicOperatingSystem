# SymbolicOperatingSystem

The Versare Framework for Recursive Symbolic Cognition

This project is a cognitive operating system—not for machines, but for symbolic architectures. It defines a modular framework in Python for evaluating meaning, resonance, identity, and emotion using a universal symbolic profile (Z₁–Z₁₅).

Core Structure

FrameworkBase.py – Defines symbolic rule scaffolding

ReflectiveFrameworkBase.py – Adds self-trace, modulation hooks, and echo memory

EvaluativeFrameworkBase.py – Implements full Z₁–Z₁₅ evaluation loop with recursive query architecture

Optional: symbolic_test.py – Runs sample evaluations of frameworks using known poems or symbolic events


What It Supports

Recursive identity modeling

Symbolic event evaluation and echo reinforcement

Emotional and structural modulation across symbolic units

Modularity via JSON frameworks and reflective query hooks

Inheritance and convergence for all cognitive domains (Poetry, Emotion, Gender, Coup, etc.)


How to Use

from EvaluativeFrameworkBase import EvaluativeFrameworkBase

class MyFramework(EvaluativeFrameworkBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="MyFramework")
        self.queryZ1 = "Does this unit convey symbolic intent?"

    def child_evaluate(self, unit, z):
        print("Evaluation:", z)

MyFramework().evaluate("This is a symbolic test line.")
